> **SQL Injection** is a method of attacking a database where an attacker inserts malicious SQL code through input fields, allowing unauthorized SQL queries to be executed.

## Consequences of SQL Injection:

-   Data theft.
-   Deletion or modification of data.
-   Gaining administrative access.

## Methods of protection against SQL injection

**1. Parameterized queries (Prepared Statements):**

-   Use parameters instead of string concatenation.
-   The DBMS automatically escapes special characters.

Example (in Java using JDBC):

```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
stmt.setString(1, username);
stmt.setString(2, password);
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
```

**2. Using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):**

-   ORM libraries often include built-in protection mechanisms against SQL injection.

**3. Input Validation and Filtering:**

-   Validate input data to match the expected format.
-   Use validation both on the server and client side.

**4. Restricting access rights:**

-   Grant only the minimum necessary privileges to database users.
-   Restrict access to system tables and operations.

**5. Using stored procedures:**

-   Encapsulates data logic within a procedure.
-   Users have access only to the procedures, not directly to the tables.
