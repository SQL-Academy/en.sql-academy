> JOIN is an operation in SQL that allows combining rows from two or more tables based on related columns between them.

## Types of JOINs:

-   `INNER JOIN`:  
    Returns records that have matching values in both tables..

-   `LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)`:  
    Returns all records from the left table and the matching records from the right table. If there is no match, it returns NULL for the right table.

-   `RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)`:  
    Returns all records from the right table and the matching records from the left table. If there is no match, it returns NULL for the left table.

-   `FULL OUTER JOIN`:  
    Returns all records where there is a match in one of the tables.

-   `CROSS JOIN`:  
    Performs a Cartesian product of two tables, combining each row of the first table with each row of the second table.
