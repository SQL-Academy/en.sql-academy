## DELETE:

-   Removes selected records from a table.
-   A `WHERE` condition can be used to delete specific records.
-   The operation is logged row by row in the transaction log.
-   `ON DELETE` triggers are activated.
-   Slower compared to `TRUNCATE`.

Example:

```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE salary < 30000;
```

## TRUNCATE:

-   Removes all records from a table with no possibility of recovery via `ROLLBACK` (in most DBMS).
-   Cannot use `WHERE`.
-   Faster since it is not logged row by row.
-   Resets identity values (if auto-increment is used).
-   Triggers are not activated.

Example:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
```
