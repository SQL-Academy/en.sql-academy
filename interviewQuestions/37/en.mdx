**A many-to-many** relationship in relational databases occurs when one record in the first table
can be associated with multiple records in the second table, and vice versa.

In SQL, such relationships are implemented using a junction table (also known as a linking or
associative table) that connects the two main tables via foreign keys.

## How to implement many-to-many relationships in SQL

-   **Create two main tables**, that need to be linked.
-   **Create a junction table**, containing foreign keys that reference the primary keys of both main tables.
-   **Define foreign keys and a composite primary key** in the junction table to ensure referential integrity and uniqueness of relationship pairs.

## Example implementation

Consider a scenario with `Student` and `Course` tables where one student can enroll in multiple courses,
and one course can be taken by multiple students.

-   Creating the students table:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Student (
        StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        Name VARCHAR(100)
    );
    ```
-   Creating the courses table:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Course (
        CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        Title VARCHAR(100)
    );
    ```
-   Creating a junction table to establish the many-to-many relationship:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE StudentCourse (
        StudentID INT,
        CourseID INT,
        PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID),
        FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID),
        FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Course(CourseID)
    );
    ```

As a result:

-   The **junction table** `StudentCourse` contains pairs of `StudentID` and `CourseID`, representing the relationships between students and courses.
-   The **composite primary key** `(StudentID, CourseID)` ensures that each pair is unique, preventing duplicate relationships.
-   The **foreign keys** ensure data integrity by referencing the corresponding records in the `Student` and `Course` tables.
