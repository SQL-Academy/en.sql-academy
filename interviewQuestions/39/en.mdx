Hash functions in SQL are used to transform input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length string.
This transformation is called **hashing**, and it is widely used to ensure security, data integrity, and optimize comparison and search operations.

## Key use cases for hash functions in SQL:

### 1. Storing passwords

-   Instead of storing passwords in plain text, they are stored as hashes. This increases security since, even if the database is compromised, attackers cannot recover the original passwords.
-   Cryptographic hash functions like `SHA-256`, `SHA-512`, and others are commonly used.

### 2. Data integrity verification

Hash functions allow detecting whether data has been altered. By creating a hash of the original data and comparing it with the current hash, changes can be identified.

### 3. Indexing and search optimization

Hash values can be used for quick comparison of large amounts of data or to create indexes for faster searches.

### 4. Creating unique identifiers

Hashing helps generate unique identifiers for records based on their content.

## Example of using hash functions in SQL:

```sql
-- Create a users table
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    PasswordHash VARBINARY(512) NOT NULL
);

-- When adding a new user, hash the password
INSERT INTO Users (UserID, Username, PasswordHash)
VALUES (1, 'user1', HASHBYTES('SHA2_512', 'password123'));

-- Verify that the entered password matches the hash in the database
SELECT UserID FROM Users
WHERE Username = 'user1' AND PasswordHash = HASHBYTES('SHA2_512', 'password123');
```

## Recommendations and considerations

### Choosing a hash function

-   Prefer modern and robust algorithms like `SHA-256` or `SHA-512`.
-   Avoid using outdated functions like `MD5` or `SHA1` due to known vulnerabilities.

### Secure storage

Store hashes in binary format (`VARBINARY`) instead of string format (`VARCHAR`) to preserve accuracy and save space.

### Irreversibility of hashes

Remember that hashing is a one-way function; the original data cannot be recovered from the hash.
