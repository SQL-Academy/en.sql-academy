    description: 'The difference between WHERE and HAVING in SQL: WHERE filters data before grouping, HAVING after. Learn when and how to use these clauses.'

## WHERE

-   Filters rows before data is grouped.
-   Cannot use aggregate functions (`SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, etc.).
-   Applies to individual records in the table.

Example:

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000
GROUP BY department_id;
```

## HAVING

-   Filters groups of rows after the data is grouped.
-   Can use aggregate functions.
-   Applies to the results of `GROUP BY`.

Example:

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS num_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```
