## What is an SQL trigger

> **An SQL trigger** is a database object representing a special type of stored procedure that automatically executes when a specific event occurs in the database.
> These events may include `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations on tables or views.

## How an SQL trigger works

A trigger is automatically activated in response to a specified event (e.g., adding a new record to a table).

### Types of triggers

-   `BEFORE`: Works before the operation is executed.  
    Used to validate or modify data before it is saved.
-   `AFTER`: Works after the operation is executed.  
    Often used for logging or updating related tables.
-   `INSTEAD OF`: Replaces the default behavior of the operation.  
    Used when you need to override the default action, such as when working with views.

Within a trigger, you can access old and new data values through special pseudo-tables: `OLD` and `NEW`.

## Example of using a trigger

Suppose we have an `Employees` table, and we want to automatically save a history of salary changes
in the `SalaryHistory` table whenever employee data is updated.

**Creating tables:**

```sql
-- Employees table
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Salary history table
CREATE TABLE SalaryHistory (
    EmployeeID INT,
    OldSalary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    NewSalary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    ChangeDate DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Creating a trigger::**

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER trg_AfterSalaryUpdate
AFTER UPDATE ON Employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF OLD.Salary <> NEW.Salary THEN
        INSERT INTO SalaryHistory (EmployeeID, OldSalary, NewSalary)
        VALUES (NEW.EmployeeID, OLD.Salary, NEW.Salary);
    END IF;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

## When to use triggers

-   **Logging and auditing**:  
     Automatically logging data changes to track user actions.
-   **Maintaining data integrity**:  
     Enforcing complex business rules that cannot be achieved through constraints.
-   **Data synchronization**:  
     Automatically updating or modifying related tables when data changes.
-   **Calculating values**:  
     Automatically calculating and updating aggregated or derived data.
