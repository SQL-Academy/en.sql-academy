> **A VIEW** is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL query. A view does not store data itself but provides a specific way to view data from one or more tables.

## Benefits of a VIEW:

-   **Simplifies complex queries**: Allows saving a complex query and using it as a simple table.
-   **Security**: Grants users access only to specific data, hiding the rest.
-   **Updatability**: In some cases, data can be updated through the view.
-   **Maintains data integrity**: Can combine data from multiple tables in a specific way.

## Example of creating a VIEW:

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_details AS
SELECT e.id, e.name, d.name AS department, e.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

## Using a VIEW:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_details WHERE salary > 50000;
```
