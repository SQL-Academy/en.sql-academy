## Stored Procedure:

-   A set of SQL commands stored on the server for reuse.
-   Can perform `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` operations.
-   May return multiple result sets or return nothing.
-   Can have input and output parameters.
-   Cannot be called within an SQL query.

Example of a stored procedure:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByID(IN emp_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id;
END;
```

Calling the procedure:

```sql
CALL GetEmployeeByID(1);
```

## Function:

-   Returns a single value (scalar function) or a table (table-valued function).
-   Can be used in SQL expressions (e.g., in SELECT or WHERE clauses).
-   Must return a value.
-   Typically used for calculations and returns a deterministic result.

Example of a function:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeeSalary(emp_id INT) RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)
BEGIN
    DECLARE salary DECIMAL(10,2);
    SELECT e.salary INTO salary FROM employees e WHERE e.id = emp_id;
    RETURN salary;
END;
```

Using the function:

```sql
SELECT name, GetEmployeeSalary(id) FROM employees;
```
