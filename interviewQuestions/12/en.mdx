> **A Trigger** r is a stored procedure that is automatically executed when a specific event occurs in the database, such as an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` on a particular table.

## Types of Triggers:

-   DML Triggers: Respond to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations.
-   DDL Triggers: Respond to `CREATE`, `ALTER`, or `DROP` operations.
-   Row-level or Statement-level Triggers.

## Advantages of triggers:

-   Automates checks and constraints.
-   Logs changes.
-   Maintains data integrity.

## Example of creating a trigger:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trg_after_insert_employee
AFTER INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_log (employee_id, action, action_time)
    VALUES (NEW.id, 'INSERT', NOW());
END;
```
