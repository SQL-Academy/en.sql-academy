Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. They are often used in combination with the `GROUP BY` clause.

## Key Aggregate Functions

-   `COUNT()` — counts the number of rows.
-   `SUM()` — calculates the sum of values.
-   `AVG()` — calculates the average value.
-   `MAX()` — finds the maximum value.
-   `MIN()` — finds the minimum value.

## Examples of usage

1. Counting the number of employees:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
```

2. Average salary by department:

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

3. Maximum salary in the company:

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;
```

4. Total sales for the month:

```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM sales WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31';
```
