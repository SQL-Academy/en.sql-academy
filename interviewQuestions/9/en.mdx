> **An Index** is a special data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations from a table by creating pointers to the data.

Indexes speed up read operations but can slow down write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) since the indexes need to be updated when the data changes.

## Advantages of Indexes:

-   Faster execution of `SELECT` operations.
-   Improved performance when sorting and searching data.

## Disadvantages of Indexes:

-   Additional disk space required.
-   Slower performance for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.

## Example of creating an index:

```sql
-- Creating an index on the name column in the employees table
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_name ON employees(name);
```
