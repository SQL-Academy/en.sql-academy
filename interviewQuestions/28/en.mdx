> **Window functions** are functions that perform calculations over a set of rows (a window) related to the current row and return a result for each row without grouping the data.

## Main window functions:

### Aggregate functions:

-   `SUM` — calculates the total sum of values
-   `COUNT` — counts the total number of records in a column
-   `AVG` — calculates the arithmetic mean
-   `MAX` — finds the maximum value
-   `MIN` — determines the minimum value

### Ranking functions:

-   `ROW_NUMBER`: assigns a sequential number to a row within the window
-   `RANK`: assigns a rank to a row within the window, with gaps when values tie
-   `DENSE_RANK`: assigns a rank to a row without gaps

### Offset functions:

-   `LAG`: returns the value from the previous row
-   `LEAD`: returns the value from the next row
-   `FIRST_VALUE`: returns the first value in the window
-   `LAST_VALUE`: returns the last value in the window
