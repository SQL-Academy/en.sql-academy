The `LIKE` operator is used in `WHERE` clauses to search for rows that match a specific pattern. Wildcards are used in the patterns:

-   `%` — matches any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence).
-   `_` — matches any single character.

## Examples of usage:

1. Searching for rows that start with “A”:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'А%';
```

2. Searching for rows that end with “e”:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE '%e';
```

3. Searching for rows where the second character is “a”:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE '_а%';
```
