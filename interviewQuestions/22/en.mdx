## INNER JOIN:

-   Returns only records that have matching entries in both joined tables.
-   If there is no match, the record is not included in the result.

Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

## OUTER JOIN:

-   Returns matching records, as well as records from one table that do not have a match in the other table.

### Types of OUTER JOIN:

**LEFT OUTER JOIN (LEFT JOIN):**

-   Returns all records from the left table and the matching records from the right table.
-   If there is no match, the columns from the right table will be `NULL`.

Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

**RIGHT OUTER JOIN (RIGHT JOIN):**

-   Returns all records from the right table and the matching records from the left table.
-   If there is no match, the columns from the left table will be `NULL`.

Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

**FULL OUTER JOIN (FULL JOIN):**

-   Returns all records where there is a match in either of the tables.
-   If there is no match, the corresponding columns will be `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```
