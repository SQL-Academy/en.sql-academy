## CHAR(n):

-   Stores fixed-length strings of length `n`.
-   If the entered string is shorter than `n`, it is padded with spaces to reach the length of `n`.
-   Used for storing data of uniform length (e.g., country codes, postal codes).

## VARCHAR(n):

-   Stores variable-length strings up to `n` characters.
-   Actually occupies as much space as the number of characters in the string plus a small overhead for storing the length.
-   Used for storing string data of variable length.

## Key differences:

Memory and performance:

-   `CHAR` always occupies a fixed amount of memory.
-   `VARCHAR` is more memory-efficient but may be slightly slower in access.

Usage:

-   `CHAR` is suitable for data with predictable length.
-   `VARCHAR` is suitable for data with variable length.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    code CHAR(10),     -- Fixed-length product code
    name VARCHAR(100)  -- Variable-length product name
);
```

Inserting data:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (code, name)
VALUES ('A123', 'Lenovo Laptop');
```

In the `code` column, the value will be padded with spaces up to 10 characters.
