## Primary Key (PRIMARY KEY):

-   A unique identifier for a record in a table.
-   Does not allow duplicates or NULL values.
-   Can consist of one or more columns (composite key).

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);
```

## Foreign Key (FOREIGN KEY)

-   A column or set of columns that refer to the primary key of another table.
-   Ensures referential integrity between tables.
-   Allows linking records from different tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
);
```
