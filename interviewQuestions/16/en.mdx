## UNION:

-   Combines the results of two or more `SELECT` queries.
-   Removes duplicates from the combined result.

Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_list FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_list FROM table2;
```

## UNION ALL:

-   Combines the results of two or more SELECT queries.
-   Retains duplicates in the combined result.
-   Performs faster as it doesnâ€™t perform the additional operation of removing duplicates.

Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_list FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_list FROM table2;
```
