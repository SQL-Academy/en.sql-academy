> **CTE (common table expression)** is a temporary named result set defined in an SQL query using the `WITH` keyword.

It enhances the readability and structure of complex queries.

## Syntax

```sql
WITH CTEName (column1, column2, ...)
AS (
     -- your query
    SELECT ...
)
SELECT * FROM CTEName;
```

## Advantages of CTE

-   Improves code readability.
-   Allows breaking down complex queries into logical parts.
-   Supports recursive queries (recursive CTEs).
