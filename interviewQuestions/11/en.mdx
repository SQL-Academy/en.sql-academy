> **A Transaction** is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit, which must be fully completed or fully rolled back.

### Transaction Properties (ACID):

**Atomicity:**

-   A transaction is fully completed or not executed at all.
-   If a failure occurs, all changes are rolled back.

**Consistency:**

-   A transaction transitions the database from one consistent state to another.
-   All database rules and constraints are maintained.

**Isolation:**

-   The results of a transaction are invisible to other transactions until it is completed.
-   Prevents interference between concurrent transactions.

**Durability:**

-   Once a transaction is successfully completed, its results are permanently saved, even in the event of system failures.
-   Changes are written to persistent storage.
