The `GRANT` and `REVOKE` commands in SQL are used to manage user access rights to database objects.

They allow granting or revoking specific privileges to or from users or roles, ensuring security and control over who can perform what actions in the database.

## GRANT

The `GRANT` command provides users or roles with specific privileges on database objects.

### Syntax:

```sql
GRANT privileges ON object TO user [WITH GRANT OPTION];
```

-   `privileges`: the actions allowed (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `ALL PRIVILEGES`).
-   `object`: the database, table, view, procedure, etc.
-   `user`: the username or role to which privileges are granted.
-   `WITH GRANT OPTION` (optional): allows the recipient of the privileges to grant them to others.

**Example:**  
To grant user `user1` the privilege to select data from the `employees` table:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user1;
```

## REVOKE

The `REVOKE` command removes previously granted privileges from users or roles.

### Syntax:

```sql
REVOKE privileges ON object FROM user;
```

**Example:**  
To revoke the `SELECT` privilege from user `user1` on the `employees`

```sql
REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM user1;
```
