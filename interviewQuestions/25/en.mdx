## COMMIT

-   Commits the current transaction.
-   All changes made during the transaction become permanent and visible to other users.
-   After a `COMMIT`, changes cannot be undone.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT;
```

## ROLLBACK

-   Reverts the current transaction.
-   All changes made during the transaction are undone.
-   The database is returned to the state it was in before the transaction began.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

DELETE FROM orders WHERE order_date < '2022-01-01';

-- If you change your mind
ROLLBACK;
```

## Usage in transaction management:

-   `BEGIN TRANSACTION` or `START TRANSACTION`: begins a transaction.
-   `COMMIT`: commits the transaction.
-   `ROLLBACK`: rolls back the transaction.
