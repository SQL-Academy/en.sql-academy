> **A FOREIGN KEY** is a constraint that establishes a relationship between a column or set of columns in one table and a column or columns in another table (typically a primary key).

It ensures referential integrity by guaranteeing that values in the foreign key column correspond to existing values in the related table.

## How data integrity is ensured:

-   **Prevents insertion of invalid data**
    It is impossible to insert a value into the foreign key column if that value does not exist in the related table.

-   **Prevents deletion of related records**
    It is impossible to delete a record from the parent table if records in the child table reference it, unless additional actions are taken.

### Example of a foreign key:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
);
```
