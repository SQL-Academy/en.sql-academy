The `CASE` operator is used to implement conditional logic in SQL queries.
It allows you to return values based on conditions, similar to the `IF-ELSE` statement.

```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ...
    ELSE default_result
END
```

## Examples

-   Assigning categories based on salary:
    ```sql
    SELECT name,
        salary,
        CASE
            WHEN salary >= 80000 THEN 'High'
            WHEN salary >= 50000 THEN 'Medium'
            ELSE 'Low'
        END AS salary_category
    FROM employees;
    ```
