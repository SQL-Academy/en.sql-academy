    description: 'DELETE removes selected records, TRUNCATE clears the entire table while preserving its structure, and DROP completely deletes the table. Learn the key differences between these commands.'

## DELETE

-   Removes selected records from a table.
-   A `WHERE` condition can be used to delete specific records.
-   The operation is logged in the transaction log row by row.
-   `ON DELETE` triggers are activated.

### Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE condition];
```

## TRUNCATE

-   Removes all data from the table without the possibility of recovery.
-   `WHERE` cannot be used.
-   Faster because it does not log the deletion of each row.
-   Resets auto-increment identifiers.
-   Triggers are not activated.

### Syntax

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

## DROP

-   Deletes the entire table along with its data, structure, indexes, and constraints.
-   The action is irreversible.

### Syntax

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

## Choosing between commands

-   Use `DELETE` when you need to remove specific records.
-   Use `TRUNCATE` to quickly remove all data from the table while keeping its structure.
-   Use `DROP` to completely remove the table from the database.
