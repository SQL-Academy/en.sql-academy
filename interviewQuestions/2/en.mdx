SQL commands are divided into three main categories:

DDL (Data Definition Language):

-   Used for defining the structure of a database (schema).
-   Key commands: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `RENAME`.

DML (Data Manipulation Language):

-   Used for working with data within tables.
-   Key commands: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.

DCL (Data Control Language):

-   Used for managing database access rights.
-   Key commands: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.
