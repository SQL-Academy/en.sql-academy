# Multi-table queries, JOIN operator

## Multi-table queries

In the previous articles, we described working with only one table of a database.
In reality, however, it is very often necessary to make a selection from several tables, somehow combining them.
In this article, you will learn the main ways to join tables.

For example, if we want to find out about expenses on purchases, we can do so as follows:

```sql
SELECT family_member, amount * unit_price AS price FROM Payments
```

| family_member | price |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 1             | 2000  |
| 2             | 2100  |
| 3             | 100   |
| 4             | 350   |
| 4             | 300   |
| 5             | 100   |
| 2             | 120   |
| 2             | 5500  |
| 5             | 230   |
| 3             | 2200  |
| 2             | 66000 |
| 1             | 40    |
| 3             | 100   |
| 3             | 1200  |

The `family_member` field in the resulting selection displays the record identifiers from the `Payments` table, but they mean little to us.

Instead of these identifiers, it would be much more informative to output the names of those who made the purchases (the `member_name` field from the `FamilyMember` table).
This is exactly why table joining and the JOIN operator exist.

## The general structure of a multi-table query

```sql
SELECT table_fields
FROM table_1
[INNER] | [[LEFT | RIGHT | FULL][OUTER]] JOIN table_2
    ON join_condition
[[INNER] | [[LEFT | RIGHT | FULL][OUTER]] JOIN table_n
    ON join_condition]
```

As can be seen from the structure, joining can be:

-   internal `INNER` (by default)
-   outer `OUTER`, in which case the outer connection is divided into `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL`.

We will learn in more detail in the next articles what the difference is between internal and external joining and how they work.

For now, it is enough for us to know that for the above example with a query for purchases,
we will need an internal connection query that will look like this:

```sql
SELECT family_member, member_name, amount * unit_price AS price FROM Payments
INNER JOIN FamilyMembers
    ON Payments.family_member = FamilyMembers.member_id
```

| family_member | member_name     | price |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----- |
| 1             | Headley Quincey | 2000  |
| 2             | Flavia Quincey  | 2100  |
| 3             | Andie Quincey   | 100   |
| 4             | Lela Quincey    | 350   |
| 4             | Lela Quincey    | 300   |
| 5             | Annie Quincey   | 100   |
| 2             | Flavia Quincey  | 120   |
| 2             | Flavia Quincey  | 5500  |
| 5             | Annie Quincey   | 230   |
| 3             | Andie Quincey   | 2200  |
| 2             | Flavia Quincey  | 66000 |
| 1             | Headley Quincey | 40    |
| 3             | Andie Quincey   | 100   |
| 3             | Andie Quincey   | 1200  |

In this query, we match records from the `Payments` table with records from the `FamilyMembers` table.

To make the matching work, we specify how exactly records from two different tables should find each other. This condition is specified after `ON`:

```sql
ON Payments.family_member = FamilyMembers.member_id
```

In our case, the `family_member` field points to the identifier in the `FamilyMembers` table and thus helps to unambiguously match.

> In most cases, the connection condition is the equality of columns in tables `(table_1.field = table_2.field)`, but other comparison operators can also be used.

## Output of all columns from a table in a multi-table query

    Previously, when all queries were executed on one table, it was enough to specify the `*` character to output all fields from this table. Now, when there can be several tables, `*` will mean "output all columns from the tables listed in the expression `FROM`".

In some cases, we may need to output columns belonging only to a particular table. For example, the connection of the `Payments` and `FamilyMembers` tables is given, and only the fields from the `FamilyMembers` table should be output to the final selection. How to do it? It's very simple! It is necessary to add the name of the table before the `*` symbol:

```sql
SELECT FamilyMembers.* FROM Payments
INNER JOIN FamilyMembers
    ON Payments.family_member = FamilyMembers.member_id
```

> Remember this option, you will need it in future tasks ðŸ˜‰

In the same way, you can output **all columns from multiple tables**:

```sql
SELECT Payments.*, FamilyMembers.* FROM Payments
INNER JOIN FamilyMembers
    ON Payments.family_member = FamilyMembers.member_id
```

> In this case, instead of `Payments.*, Family Members.*` you can use `*`, because only these two tables are listed in the `FROM` clause. The output will be the same in both cases.

But what if you need to output **several columns from one table and all from another**? This is also possible! Output the `payment_id` and `family_member` fields from `Payments`, as well as the fields from `FamilyMembers`:

```sql
SELECT payment_id, family_member, FamilyMembers.* FROM Payments
INNER JOIN FamilyMembers
    ON Payments.family_member = FamilyMembers.member_id
```

## Table Aliases

When working with complex multi-table queries, it's recommended to use table aliases. This not only improves code readability but also helps avoid errors in complex queries.

Aliases are specified after the table name using the `AS` keyword:

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM Passenger AS pass
```

Now you can reference table columns through the alias:

```sql
SELECT pass.id, pass.name
FROM Passenger AS pass
```

> The `AS` keyword is optional, same as with column aliases.

> After you have assigned an alias to a table, you will need to use the new alias in place of the original table name in order to access its columns. The syntax for referencing columns will change from `<table>.<column>` to `<table_alias>.<column>`.

Let's examine a multi-table query example. Suppose we want to display IDs and names of passengers who have flown at least once:

```sql
SELECT
    pass.id,
    pass.name
FROM Passenger AS pass
INNER JOIN Pass_in_trip AS pit
    ON pit.passenger = pass.id
```

In this example, the Passenger and Pass_in_trip tables are assigned aliases `pass` and `pit` respectively, which are then used to reference columns from these tables. Note that both tables contain a column named `id`. If you don't specify which table to take it from, the DBMS will automatically select the value from the **last table** in the JOIN chain (in this case, `Pass_in_trip`).

Compare this with the version without aliases. Isn't this much better? ðŸ”¥

```sql
SELECT
    Passenger.id,
    Passenger.name
FROM Passenger
INNER JOIN Pass_in_trip
    ON Pass_in_trip.passenger = Passenger.id
```

When using aliases, always follow these simple rules to keep your queries concise and clear:

-   Use logical abbreviations (e.g., first letters of the table name)
-   Avoid overly short (single-character) or non-intuitive aliases
