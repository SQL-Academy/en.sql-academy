# Types of databases

This course is designed to help you master the query language for relational databases, which
are unconditionally ahead of other types of databases in popularity.

But I want you to understand that databases are not limited only to them.
Therefore, we will also get acquainted very briefly with other representatives of the database family.
You can regard it as a visit to the zoo 🦁 – to quickly and briefly see unusual creatures.

Of course, we will pay special attention to relational databases in the future.

There are quite a lot of database classifications, but let's focus on the most popular ones:

- Relational databases
- Key-value databases
- Document-oriented databases
