# About the course

This course, aimed at learning SQL, is designed differently than most other courses.
We will not try to learn all possible sets of SQL functions, instead we will focus our attention on the principles of how queries are constructed and
on the basis of which operators these queries are implemented.

To achieve this goal, the course is equipped with a large number of exercises that should help build the very necessary connections in our brain, so that in the future you do not have
to think much when making queries to databases.

During the course, we strongly recommend that you cultivate a "growth mindset": if you encounter any difficulties trying
to understand a new topic or doing exercises, try to transform the frustrating experience into a productive one.  
And the most important thing in this course is **have fun!**

## Take the course publicly

You can take the course publicly and share your progress - it's a great way to motivate yourself.
Please feel free to talk about your success during the course on social networks and streaming services.
You can use the hashtag `#sql-academy` if you want.

## Device support

This course is designed to pass from a computer and laptop - the most optimal devices for writing SQL queries. The course can also be taken from a tablet or from a phone,
but some functionality may not be available or work incorrectly. Please treat this with understanding.
