# Stored Procedures and Functions

In SQL, beyond regular queries, there are more powerful tools — **stored procedures** and **stored functions**.
These objects allow you to create ready-made code blocks that can be used repeatedly 🔄.

> **Stored procedures and functions** are pre-written SQL scripts saved in the database that can be called by name.

Imagine you have a complex query for calculating sales statistics that you use every day.
Instead of rewriting it each time, you can create a procedure or function and simply call it!

## Why do we need them?

Stored procedures and functions solve several important tasks:

-   **🚀 Code Reusability** — write once, use everywhere. No more copies of the same code in different places.
-   **⚡ Performance** — code executes directly on the database server, which is often faster than regular queries.
-   **🔒 Security** — you can grant access to a procedure without giving direct access to tables.
-   **🛡️ Centralized Logic** — all business logic is in one place, in the database.

## Key Differences

Although procedures and functions are similar, there are important differences between them:

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Return Value**      | May not return or return multiple values | Always returns a single value                            |
| **Usage in Queries**  | Called separately                        | Can be used in SELECT, WHERE, and other parts of queries |
| **Data Modification** | Can modify data in tables                | Designed only for reading data                           |
| **Invocation**        | `CALL procedure_name()`                  | `SELECT function_name()`                                 |

## When to use procedures?

**Stored procedures** work best when you need to:

-   Execute a sequence of operations (e.g., create order, deduct inventory, send notification)
-   Modify data in multiple tables simultaneously
-   Implement complex business logic
-   Return multiple result sets

### Procedure Usage Example

Let's say we need to create a procedure for order processing:

```sql
-- Example procedure call (conceptual)
CALL create_order(customer_id = 123, product_id = 456, quantity = 2);
```

Such a procedure can:

1. Check product availability in stock
2. Create a record in the orders table
3. Update product inventory
4. Add a record to operation history

## When to use functions?

**Stored functions** are ideal when you need to:

-   Perform calculations and return a result
-   Create a reusable formula
-   Transform data in a specific way
-   Use the result in other SQL queries

### Function Usage Example

Let's create a function for discount calculation:

```sql
-- Example of using function in a query
SELECT
    product_name,
    price,
    calculate_discount(price, customer_type) AS discount_amount
FROM Products;
```

Such a function takes price and customer type, and returns the discount amount that can be used in any queries.

## Simple Selection Rule

If you're unsure what to choose, use this simple rule:

-   **Need to get a single value for use in a query?** → Function
-   **Need to execute a set of actions or modify data?** → Procedure
