# Working with Data Types

We have already familiarized ourselves with data types in SQL and
have written dozens of queries on different types of data. The more extensive our knowledge
becomes, the deeper we can dive into more advanced topics üê≥. If our previous task was to quickly
skim through SQL to get a general understanding and be able to write basic queries, now we
will strive to cover the material more comprehensively.

In the next few lessons, we will look at the features of data types that most often cause problems and errors when working with them.
Through practical exercises, we will immediately tackle the most challenging aspects to ensure
they don't pose problems when composing queries in the future.
