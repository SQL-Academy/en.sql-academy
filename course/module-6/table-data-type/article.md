# Data types for table columns

In SQL, each column in a table must have a specific data type that specifies what type of information can be stored in that column.
The data type of a column determines what operations can be performed on the data in that column, how much space is required to store the data, and how the data is stored internally.

There are several common data types in SQL, including:

- String data type
- Numeric data type
- Boolean data type
- Date and time

When defining a table in SQL, it is important to choose appropriate data types for each column to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of data.
It is also important to consider the possible range of values that will be stored in each column and choose a data type that is appropriate for that range.

In the following articles, we will delve into each type in detail.
